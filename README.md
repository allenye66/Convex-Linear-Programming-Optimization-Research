# LP-Optimization
Research on heavily optimized online and offline convex linear programming algorithms and tested their efficiency and accuracy with various complexities of input data in Matlab and Python. 

Complexities under different K values(1-2000):
- O(n)
  - as K increases, accuracy remains mostly constant
- O(1)
  - as K increases, accuracy greatly increases
